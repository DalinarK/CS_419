You can put files on the VM by putting it in /vagrant folder. From there you can either create a symbolic link or if you can’t do that use command line copy command to copy it to the next folder. 
To get into the VM type “vagrant up”
Then “vagrant ssh”
To check email, type fetchmail
To open email type mutt

.procmailrc is stored in /home/vagrant. Cannot create a symbolic link from it. Also you cannot see it if  you type ls because it has a “.” In front of it which gets hidden in linux. You have to type ls –a to see it. 

The python script writes to the folder /home/vagrant/Mail folder
The shared folder is stored in 
/vagrant
Created a symbolic link from /vagrant/ to /home/vagrant
When doing cat >> testfile. The output goes to /home/vagrant/Mail
Flip doesn’t allow sql queries from server. Need to figure out an alternate implementation.
Either send query to an EC2 instance. Run query from linux box. Or run sqllite?

To connect to the db type "sqlite3 [nameofdb.db]" in the folder the database is stored

Apparantly working on this in sublime adds random characters at the end of .procmailrc and other rc files and makes them now work. So I have to edit them in VI on flip!
